            <h2>Lowriding</h2>

            <p>My first car was a 78 monte carlo. I bought it stock in yakima Wa for $4300 drove it back to
                sf and turned it into a lowrider. After putting in some more money I sold the car for 13K as a lowrider.
            </p>
            <p>My next few cars were these two el caminos, 1979 and 1980. I didnt change any of the suspension, but i
                did do some engine work and put wire wheels and a bumping sound system in both. I also changed the
                carpets and headliners. Paid 5K for both and sold them both for 10K.</p>
            <p>My next car was a 1970 monte carlo. Found it in arizona and drove it home 12 hours back to San Fransisco.
                Turned it into a lowrider, and sold it. I paid 18K for the stock car and sold it for 25K as a lowrider.
            </p>
            <p>My current car is a 1961 2 door impala. They call that year the bubbletop because the back glass is like
                a spaceship. I paid 47K for the car and I have big plans for it. Hydraulics, painted rooftop patterns,
                and cleaning up the engine compartment are a few of the things i wanna do. This car might be a keeper,
                but everthing has its price!</p>

            <p>Skateboarding has been apart of my life for 20 years now. It has taught my some very
                important life lessons, and has shown me alot about myself. Through thick and thin skatebaording has
                alwasys
                been there for me as an outlet for time when im mad, sad, or going through a rough time.</p>
            <p>Iv learned that if you can picture it in your mind, you can pretty much do it on a skateboard. Dedicaton,
                determination, persistence, dealing with pain and failure, blood sweat and tears, overcoming fear and
                gaining confidence has been engrained in me through skateboading. "I can do anything I put my mind to."
